            <p><strong>What is a Linux Distribution?</strong></p>
            <p>A Linux distribution, or distro as it is commonly called, is simply a version of Linux that can be installed.
                Different distributions can cater to a users specific needs, but it is all Linux under the hood.</p>

            <p><strong>What is a bootable USB?</strong></p>
            <p>A bootable USB is any USB drive that can boot an operating system. If you have ever manually installed Windows, you may
                remember that it was done by inserting a USB drive into your computer. Linus is no different, but these drives must be
                created by the user as they are not sold.</p>
                
            <p><strong>Is this safe?</strong></p>
            <p>The only real risk is losing your data if you do not properly create a backup. You can always return to your previous OS
                if you later decide that Linux is not for you.</p>
